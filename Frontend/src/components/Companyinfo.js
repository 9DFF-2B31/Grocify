1. Introduction
In an era where convenience and speed are the cornerstone of customer expectations, Grocify emerges as a modern, efficient, and user-friendly online grocery marketplace. Designed with a dual-role system — for both users and sellers — Grocify bridges the gap between local produce vendors and consumers, enabling seamless shopping experiences through cash-on-delivery and online payment integration.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), with integrated online payments via Stripe, Grocify provides a robust backend infrastructure and a fluid, intuitive frontend for daily grocery needs.

2. Website Overview and Philosophy
Mission Statement
"Harvesting Happiness, Delivering Daily" — Grocify aims to deliver not just groceries but convenience, freshness, and trust, directly to customers' doorsteps. This slogan, prominently displayed on the homepage banner, summarizes the platform's goal: delight customers with quality products and timely service.

User-Centric Design
Grocify’s UI/UX design reflects minimalism and clarity. Bright images, clear typography, and a logical flow guide the user from browsing to checkout with minimal friction.
